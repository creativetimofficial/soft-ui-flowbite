Build your website faster with an Innovative Admin Template based on TailwindCSS, Flowbite, and HTML. Soft UI Flowbite features a huge number of components built to fit together and look amazing.

If you like the look & feel of the hottest design trends right now, you will definitely fall in love with this dashboard. Its design is inspired by Soft UI Design and it gives you the flexibility that will get you going in no time.

If you are looking to take your app to the next level – Soft UI Flowbite is the way to go.

**Fully Coded Components**<br />
Soft UI Flowbite is built with over 30 frontend individual elements, like buttons, inputs, navbars, nav tabs, cards, or alerts, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in color, which you can easily modify using TailwindCSS config and classes. You will save a lot of time going from prototyping to full-functional code because all elements are implemented.

This Free Dashboard is coming with prebuilt design blocks, so the development process is seamless, switching from our pages to the real website is very easy to be done.
